# SkillSwap Frontend

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (14+)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- A running instance of the SkillSwap Backend?

### Installation & Running

1. Clone the repository (frontend branch):

   cd SkillSwap

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Run the development server:
   npm run serve

4. Build for production:
   npm run build

### Configuration

- **API Endpoints:** Update the API base URL in the project’s configuration (for example, in an .env file or a dedicated config file) so it points to your running backend instance.

## Deployment

- **Containerization (Optional):** A Dockerfile can be used to containerize the Vue application.
- **Hosting:** Deploy on any static site hosting (Netlify)

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> - This README focuses on the frontend. The backend is maintained separately.
> - This documentation may evolve as the project matures.
